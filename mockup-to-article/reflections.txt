Your response goes here!

1. I've learned how to take someone else's idea of how a page should look and using HTML make that idea a reality.

2. Most of this has been easy since I've done some basic web development in the past.

3. Since most of my HTML coding was done back before HTML 5, I needed to look up a couple of the tags to remind myself of their use.

4. Just pay attention to what you see in both the mockup and actual web page. If you see something that doesn't look right, think about it for a minute and if you need to, refer to the MDN to see how the tag is used or which tag to use.
